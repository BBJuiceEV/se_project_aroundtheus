**Intro**

Project Around The US was made to bring together and test all the elements I had learned in TripleTen sprint 3 to make a responsive design webpage. This webpage is designed to respond and adapt to the many differet devices and screen sizes that the world has and uses, from the screen size of laptops down to the screen of a smartphone. To make this webpage be responsive I used a combination of Grid and Flexbox to make it happen, and as well as used git to save the project to the repository that was specifically made for this project to save it and come back to other branches of the projects code if needed. In this project you will see that as screen size gets smaller it immediately adjusts the font size in some areas, as well as changing the colums of the pictures to compensate in the lack of screen size, changing the layout to make everything look nice and readable to the eyes of everyone who enters the website.
